    <h2>Building a Multitenant Web App: From Data Visualization to Full-Scale Cloud Hosted Web App</h2>
    <div>
        <h3>How It Started</h3>
        <p>
            This project began with a focus on front-end data visualization. The goal was to create an intuitive way for sales representatives
            to track key metrics and make data-driven decisions. As the project progressed, discussions expanded to the full vision and scope of the application.
        </p>
        <p>
            The backend needed to incorporate data from two additional sources: the company's warehousing/inventory software and their old BI system.
            We identified a significant opportunity—allowing B2B clients to view their order history, track sales performance, and seamlessly request new inventory
            while browsing the product catalog. This alignment with business goals led to the decision to develop a multitenant application.
        </p>

        <h3>The Tech Stack</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blazor:</strong> Modern, component-based frontend framework.</li>
            <li><strong>ASP.NET Core:</strong> Secure, scalable backend for handling authentication and data processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Azure:</strong> Deployment for scalability and reliability.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Ocean:</strong> Blob storage.</li>
            <li><strong>GitHub Actions:</strong> CI/CD, automating testing and deployment.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Authentication and Authorization</h3>
    <p>
        Handling authentication and authorization for multiple tenants was a key focus. We implemented a shared database and shared schema to streamline development and
        get the app running quickly. ASP.NET Core Identity, along with JWT-based authentication, provided a secure and reliable solution.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Visualization and Analytics</h3>
    <p>
        Sales reps rely on quick, digestible insights to make informed decisions. Using Blazor’s component model, I developed dynamic charts and visualizations, converting raw data into meaningful metrics.
        Additionally, I implemented sortable, searchable, and filterable lists with key metric aggregations to provide users with exactly the information they needed.
    </p>

    <h3>ETL Processes</h3>
    <p>
        Integrating data from multiple sources required building efficient ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines. These processes pull data from the warehousing system and BI system,
        transform the data, and load it into our structured format.
    </p>

    <h3>Implementing Presigned URLs with Digital Ocean and S3</h3>
    <p>
        A key feature of the app involved handling secure file uploads and downloads. To achieve this, I implemented presigned URLs using Digital Ocean Spaces and S3-compatible APIs.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Client requests a presigned URL from ASP.NET Core.</li>
        <li>ASP.NET Core requests the URL from Digital Ocean Spaces.</li>
        <li>ASP.NET Core returns the presigned URL to the frontend.</li>
        <li>Client uploads the file directly using the presigned URL.</li>
        <li>Client notifies the backend that the upload is complete.</li>
        <li>ASP.NET Core verifies the file on Digital Ocean.</li>
        <li>ASP.NET Core stores file reference in the database and returns a file ID.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Responsive Web Design</h3>
    <p>
        Given that users would be accessing the app from mobile phones, tablets, and desktops, I focused heavily on responsive design. Blazor’s component-based architecture
        made it easy to adjust layouts dynamically and ensure compatibility across devices.
    </p>

    <h3>Collaboration and Agile Development</h3>
    <p>
        Ongoing collaboration with stakeholders was essential to refining the product. I worked iteratively, prioritizing features based on direct user feedback.
        Using Git for version control, I maintained an organized workflow, ensuring smooth updates and efficient bug fixes.
    </p>

    <h3>User Adoption and Encouraging Feedback</h3>
    <p>
        Successfully rolling out the application required more than just development—it involved driving user adoption. I presented the platform to key stakeholders,
        demonstrating its capabilities and gathering feedback.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        This project evolved from simple data visualization into a full-scale multitenant BI platform, integrating complex authentication, analytics, and data processing.
        Developing scalable solutions while ensuring an intuitive user experience was both a challenge and a rewarding experience.
