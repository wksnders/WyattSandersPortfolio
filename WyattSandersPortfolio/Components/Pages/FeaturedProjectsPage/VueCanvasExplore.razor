        <h3 class="subheader-text weight-heavy">Boids Particle System</h3>
        <p class="body-text">
            This project combines a basic particle system with the boids algorithm, a simple set of rules that simulate flocking behavior. 
            The particles react to mouse movement and maintain cohesive yet dynamic motion.

    <h3 class="subheader-text weight-heavy">Breakout Game</h3>
    <p class="body-text">
        A recreation of the classic Breakout game, featuring simple adjustable parameters for paddle speed, ball physics, and brick layout. 
        The game is fully playable in the browser and serves as a great introduction to collision detection and basic game loops using the canvas.
